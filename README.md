ExCoveralls [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/parroty/excoveralls.png?branch=master "Build Status")](http://travis-ci.org/parroty/excoveralls) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/parroty/excoveralls/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/parroty/excoveralls?branch=master)
============

A library to post coverage stats to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) service.
It uses Erlang's [cover](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/cover.html) to generate coverage information, and post it to coveralls' json API.

Curerntly, it's under trial for travis-ci integration. [coverage_sample](https://github.com/parroty/coverage_sample) is an example using from a project.

## Run at Travis-CI
### .travis.yml
Specify "mix coveralls.travis" as after_success section of .travis.yml

```
language: erlang
otp_release:
  - R16B
before_install:
  - git clone https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir
  - cd elixir && make && cd ..
before_script: "export PATH=`pwd`/elixir/bin:$PATH"
script: "MIX_ENV=test mix do deps.get, test"
after_success:
  - "mix coveralls.travis"
```

### Notes
- If meck library is used, it shows some warnings.

### TODO
- It depends on curl command for posting JSON. Replace it with Elixir library.
  - Tried to use hackney, but doesn't work well.
